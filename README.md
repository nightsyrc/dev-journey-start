# 💻 Cristian's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive developer portfolio — a custom-built, responsive web app that highlights my journey from SaaS operations and support to full-stack development. This project reflects my technical growth, personality, and commitment to learning by building.

## 🧠 About the Project

This site serves as both:
- a **living resume** of my tech experience,
- and a **playground** for front-end & JavaScript experimentation.

It includes:
- 📸 A visual hero + about section
- 🧑‍💻 Project cards (dynamically generated from an array)
- 💬 A DOM-based message board (try typing a message!)
- 🧠 A personality profile rendered from JSON data
- 🎠 An auto-scrolling carousel of companies I've worked with
